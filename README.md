<h1  style="font-weight: 700;">Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>
I'm Rizky Ilham Pratama,  a final semester student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Polytechnic State of Banjarmasin and a junior web developer.</p>
<p>
As a junior web developer, I have built several portfolios and projects that showcase my skills and abilities. These projects have allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web development technologies. While I have gained valuable experience working on individual projects, I am eager to expand my knowledge and expertise by collaborating with a team on a larger-scale project.</p>
<p>
Although I haven't had the opportunity to work in a team setting yet, I am highly motivated to contribute my skills and learn from experienced developers. I am confident that my ability to adapt quickly, my strong problem-solving skills, and my passion for continuous learning will enable me to effectively contribute to any development team.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to get a better understanding of the projects I have worked on. I am open to new opportunities and excited to engage in collaborative projects that will further enhance my skills as a web developer.
</p>
<p>
Let's connect and explore the possibilities of working together on exciting web development endeavors!
</p>
<p>
Cheers, <br>
Rizky Ilham Pratama
